# defcon-workshop

* Please send your email addresses to `anshuman dot bhartiya at gmail dot com` to request an invitation to join the `defcon-workshop` Slack group. This group will be used during the workshop to help troubleshoot any problems, ask questions, etc.

* This repository has all the code that will be presented/used in our Defcon Workshop - [Harnessing the Power of Docker and Kubernetes to Supercharge Your Hacking Tactics](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/harnessing-the-power-of-docker-and-kubernetes-to-supercharge-your-hacking-tactics-octavius-7-tickets-35851060487).

* The entire workshop is divided into 4 Sections. We will walk through the basics including the setting up of all the software and tools necessary to understand the concepts.

* Finally, we will finish off the workshop with some advanced use cases and demonstrate how such usecases/workflows can be used to automate and scale security testing using Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform.
