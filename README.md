# defcon-workshop

* We have a `defcon-workshop` Slack group that will be used to help troubleshoot, collaborate, figuring out pre-requisites before the workshop, answering any questions, getting feedback, etc.

Please join this Slack group by clicking on this link - https://join.slack.com/t/defcon-workshop/shared_invite/MjE3MjIxNjk1MDkyLTE1MDA5NTc1MjMtNmU2NjYwMTM1NA.

You can also send your email addresses to `anshuman dot bhartiya at gmail dot com` to request an invitation to join the group.

* This repository has all the code that will be presented/used in our Defcon Workshop - [Harnessing the Power of Docker and Kubernetes to Supercharge Your Hacking Tactics](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/harnessing-the-power-of-docker-and-kubernetes-to-supercharge-your-hacking-tactics-octavius-7-tickets-35851060487).

* The entire workshop is divided into 4 Sections. We will walk through the basics including the setting up of all the software and tools necessary to understand the concepts.

* Finally, we will finish off the workshop with some advanced use cases and demonstrate how they can be used to automate and scale security testing using Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform.
